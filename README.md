# RediDB
## Important: This was discontinued.
RedCrafter07's version of MongoDB

RediDB is a fast and simple database (or datastore, if you want to be specific) inspired by MongoDB. In this readme, you will be guided through the installation process of RediDB.

## Installation
To install, you first have to install Docker and Docker Compose. After doing so, you can copy the docker-compose.yaml file to your system. If you're using a tool like Portainer, you can just copy the content of the Docker Compose file. And that's it!
